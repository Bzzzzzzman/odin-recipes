        <h2> Ingredients</h2>
        These are the ingredients you'll need to make our top-rated lemon 
        meringue pie recipe:
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>For the filling:</strong>
                <ul>
                <li>1 cup white sugar </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>                    
                <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>                    
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>                    
                <li>1 ½ cups water</li>                    
                <li>2 lemons, juiced and zested</li>                    
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>    
                <li>4 egg yolks, beaten</li>
                <li>1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked</li>
                </ul>  </li>
            <li> <strong>For the meringue: </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>4 egg whites</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            </ul> </li>
        </ul> 
        You'll also need a baked pie crust. Buy one from the store 
        or make your own pastry crust at home. A shortbread crust is also 
        a great option.
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To make the filling: Whisk 1 cup sugar, flour, cornstarch, 
                and salt together in a medium saucepan; stir in water, 
                lemon juice, and lemon zest. Cook over medium-high heat, 
                stirring frequently, until mixture comes to a boil. Stir in 
                butter.</li>
            <li>Place egg yolks in a small bowl and gradually whisk in 1/2 
                cup of hot sugar mixture. Whisk egg yolk mixture back into 
                remaining sugar mixture. Bring to a boil and continue to 
                cook while stirring constantly until thick. Remove from 
                heat; pour filling into baked pastry shell.</li>
            <LI>To make the meringue: Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, 
                or ceramic bowl until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing 
                to beat until stiff peaks form. Spread meringue over pie 
                filling, sealing the edges at the crust.</LI>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until meringue is golden brown, about 
                10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
